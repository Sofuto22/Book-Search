# Book Search

## Description

This project was to make a book search application that user can you use to save and remove books from their profile. It had a started code so mostly what I did was add in the required files and connections to the apollo server. It has added mutations for saving and removing books as well. I still have a lot of work to go with understanding how to handle mutations.

## Installation

npm i apollo-server-express@2.15.0

if you are trying to clone and use the repo

## Usage

Unsure how to deal with the pre-receive hook, I attempted to push it from my github but it is not allowing it
